# What is GSTAL? 

GSTAL is a variant on the STAL programming language orginally proposed by Gerald Wildenberg. His original paper can be read [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/122089.122092). The main goal of STAL is to serve as a target language in a compiler construction class.

GSTAL was developed by Dr. Bryan Crawley during his time at Georgetown College, hence the G. It is modified to add support for floating point operations.

# What the BC GSTAL Debugger? 

The BC GSTAL Debugger is a GUI application that enables the writing and debugging of GSTAL code. Features include breakpoints, pause and continue, and a visualizaion of the memory of the GSTAL virtual machine. 

It was developed at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tenessse.
